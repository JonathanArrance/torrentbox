# Torrent box
An automated torrent box that can be used from anywhere. Dump your torrents into a sync folder and automatically pull down torrents.

## Background
In a mobile world it can be cumbersome to download a large torrent file, especially while out on the go. It can also be against the rules of some public wifi access points to do so.
So, in oder to get around these limitations you will need to have a torrent base station set up at home that can act like a torrent concierge.

## Parts Needed
1. Single board computer(SBC) - in this walkthrough Raspberry PI 3(PI3) is used, but any should work.
2. USB flash drive or HD - we will be using a sandisk 64GB flash drive but any size should work.
3. Owncloud Community edition or Google Drive account.
4. Transmission torrent client
5. Raspberry Pi OS - used on PI3
